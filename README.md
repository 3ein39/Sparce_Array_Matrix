# Sparce 1D Array

Representing an array of very huge indices (e.g. 10^8) using doubly linked list .. 

- In some applications, we might want to represent an array with indices very huge (e.g. 10^8), however, most of it are just zeros (e.g. 95%).
- Creating such huge arrays is very time & memory harmful with no return.
* The following functions are supported :
    - Set & Get positions.
    - Print & Add arrays.
